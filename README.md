Student Management System provides a simple interface for maintenance of student
records. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to maintain the records of students easily. The creation and
management of accurate, up-to-date information regarding a student is critically important in the
schools as well as colleges. Using the student management system the admin can add new records provided that he can update
and delete the records as per his/her requirements.
